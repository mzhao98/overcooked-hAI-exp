                    You have been invited to take part in a research study: Collaborative Cooking with an AI Agent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These collaborative cooking games are part of a research study conducted at Carnegie Mellon University.
                        The purpose of the research is to understand human-AI teaming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> Procedures  </strong>
                        Your task is to perform 10 rounds of 1-minute cooking tasks with different AI partners.
                        Instructions will be displayed for each task. You may periodically during
                        and/or after the task be asked to respond to brief questions about your thoughts and feelings, including your
                        preferences in collaborating with each agent.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong> Participant Requirements   </strong>
                        Participation in this study is limited to individuals age 18 and older who are fluent English speakers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong> Risks   </strong>
                        The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study are no greater than those ordinarily
                        encountered in daily life or during other online activities.  These could include boredom or fatigue,
                        or may include mild negative emotions when being reminded of certain life experiences. We
                        expect these to be mild and will only last for a brief amount of time.  There is also a small
                        risk of breach of confidentiality by associating your data with your name; however, this risk is
                        small since names are not stored in our data files. While in many studies of human behavior,
                        including this one, we cannot tell you about everything we are examining since we don't want you
                        to change your behavior, we would never mislead you about what data are being collected or about
                        any anticipated risks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong> Benefits   </strong>
                        There may be no personal benefit from your participation in the study but the knowledge received may be of value to humanity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong> Compensation & Costs </strong>
                        The study is expected to last 20-25 minutes and you will be compensated $4.00 (rate of $9.50 per hour) for your time.
                        In addition, up to $5.00 bonus compensation depends on your performance and the performance of other members of your group.
                        Thus, your total payment will range between [$4.00-$9.00].

                        There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.
                    </p>

                        identified. By participating, you understand and agree that the data and information gathered
                        during this study may be used by Carnegie Mellon and published and/or disclosed by Carnegie

                        identifiers will not be mentioned in any such publication or dissemination of the research data
                        and/or results by Carnegie Mellon. Note that per regulation all research data must be kept for a
                        minimum of 3 years.
